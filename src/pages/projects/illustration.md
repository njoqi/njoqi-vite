## Original characters

![](/assets/images/projects/illustration/peenegie.jpg){height=1301 width=920}  
==Péenegie== (pronounced like "PNJ" in French, meaning "NPC") is a non-playable creature who saves your state and provides guidance whenever you feel lost.

![](/assets/images/projects/illustration/cantina.png){height=1147 width=1200}
==The Underside Cantina== is a diverse cast of creatures from other realities.


## Fanart

![Rayman in its original 2D style.](/assets/images/projects/illustration/rayman.jpg){height=938 width=1200}
![Mr Dark and .](/assets/images/projects/illustration/mr-dark.jpg){height=960 width=1200}
The original 2D platformer ==Rayman== is one of my earliest videogame memories, wonderfully improved in [Rayman Redemption](https://gamejolt.com/games/raymanredemption/340532). I also enjoyed its modern 2D revivals.


![Tails and Charmy, anthropomorphic fox and bee, from the Sonic franchise.](/assets/images/projects/illustration/dress-boy.jpg){height=1301 width=920}  
I like many characters in ==Sonic the Hedgehog==, and its large base of fan creators can be surprisingly creative.
